This workflow will play/pause the focusatwill.com in your Apple Safari
browser, and also let you move to the next track.  It will not bring Safari
to the front or activate the focus@will tab.

Hotkeys are stripped on import, so you'll need to go set what you prefer.
I use Cmd-Ctrl-Z for play/pause and Cmd-Ctrl-X for next track.
